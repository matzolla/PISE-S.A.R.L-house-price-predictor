# PISE-S.A.R.L-house-price-predictor
As an Intern at PISE, My boss asked me to develop a machine learning model to predict the prices of real estate properties,
So I decided to built one simple linear model which i deployed using streamlit to see how user can have access to it.
The program is subdivided into two part, 
```
1. Building the Linear model (a quite good performance) 
2. Save the model to be used on streamlit
3. Create a simple api to take input from users, and finally deploy an interface with streamlit.
4. The dependencies used are: *streamlit* and *ngrok* as seen on the jupyter notebook provided in this repo
```

This is just a prototype ment for fun!!!, enjoy
5.  All have been done on  google colab
6.  The dataset used is available in this link: [here](https://www.kaggle.com/quantbruce/real-estate-price-prediction)

## How it works
* If you want to train the model again, run the jupyter notebook to ubtain the weights for predictions
* make sure the *app.py* is in thesame directory as the *notebook* 
* Install all dependencies (numpy,pandas,matplotlib, streamlit,pyngrok)
